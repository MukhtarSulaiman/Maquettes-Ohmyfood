# Name of the project: La Chouette agence

This project is part of my remote training as a web developer at OpenClassrooms. The site was already built by the school but it had many issues related to SEO, such as loading speed, accessibility, best practices, etc. 
So I improved the site by reducing the loading time, using technologies that make the site more accessible and adopting seo mthodes that help index the site better.
